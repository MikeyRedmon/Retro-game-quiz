## Project Goals

### Design Objectives

- Intuitive Experiance
- Clean Design
- A good selection of questions across all three IPs
- Provide a solid code base for future updates

### User Goals

- As a user, I want to be able to understand what this website is from the landing page. 
- As a user, I want to be able to revert to the homepage and restart the quiz from the end page. 
- As a user, I want to be able to read the rules of the quiz and give feedback from the main page. 

# Existing Features

### Rules and Feedback dynamic Buttons

Featured on the landing page, these two buttons when clicked push the rules of the quiz and a form for feedback onto the page; allowing seemless feedback for the user.

When the Rules button is clicked again it reverts back to only having the buttons on the page. The same thing applies for the Form button/

## Testing

The features of the website; that being the landing page and its buttons; the score tracker and custom response messages all give the correct return values. 

I tested all these items by clicking on the buttons to see if it deployed the correct content into the page and tested the custom results messages, making sure they deployed on the correct number of answers.

### Validator 

All the Validator checks came back clear and clean, with no bugs or errors.
