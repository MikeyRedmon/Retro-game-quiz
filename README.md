## Project Goals

### Design Objectives

- Intuitive Experiance
- Clean Design
- A good selection of questions across all three IPs
- Provide a solid code base for future updates

### User Goals

- As a user, I want to be able to understand what this website is from the landing page. 
- As a user, I want to be able to revert to the homepage and restart the quiz from the end page. 
- As a user, I want to be able to read the rules of the quiz and give feedback from the main page. 

### Design Ethos. 

When designing the website, I decided that a gradiant background of Blue to Black would be the best option, as those two colours are synonymous with the Playstation 2. This is the same reason I chose the Roboto font as it reminds me of the Playstation 2 font. 

The Welcome and Quiz containers are black with white text for contrast, in order to make them easy to read. 

The buttons on the Welcome and Quiz containers are a light blue and turn green when they are pressed. The Return Home button is black as to stand out from the rest of the buttons as a unique asset. 

# Existing Features

### Rules and Feedback dynamic Buttons

![The Landing Page.](./assets/images/landingpage.png)

Featured on the landing page, these two buttons when clicked push the rules of the quiz and a form for feedback onto the page; allowing seemless feedback for the user.

When the Rules button is clicked again it reverts back to only having the buttons on the page. The same thing applies for the Form button/
